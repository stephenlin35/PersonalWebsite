# My Personal Website
A simple website for me to show employers.

##Future checkpoints
* ~~Use PHP to include HTML navigator bar in all pages~~ Used Flask (Jinga2) instead
* ~~Create Resume, Projects, and Contact page~~
* ~~Optimize website~~ 
* Create a Reading List for 2017
* Finish editing Resume page

==NOTE==: I was going to post the complete website code on GitHub, however due to some security concerns involving the Contact page's mail code. Until I find a better solution, it will not be posted.
