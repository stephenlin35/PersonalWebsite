# My Personal Website
A simple website for me to show employers.

##Future checkpoints
* [ ] ~~Use PHP to include HTML navigator bar in all pages~~ 
  * [x] Used Flask (Jinga2) instead
* [x]~~Create Resume, Projects, and Contact page~~
* [ ]Optimize website
* [ ]Create a Reading List for 2017
* [x]~~Finish editing Resume page~~

~~**NOTE**: I was going to post the complete website code on GitHub, however due to some security concerns involving the Contact page's mail code. Until I find a better solution, it will not be posted.~~

Website is now up and running at: www.stephenlin.info

**NOTE**: There's still a couple bugs that appear in different screen solutions and browsers. Works best on larger displays.
